Dir::Iterate implements equivalents to the built-in C<map> and C<grep> functions
which traverse directories instead of arrays.  The block will be called for 
each file and directory below the given list of directories.  It acts as a 
more usable layer on top of File::Find.

Install it by following the standard steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
